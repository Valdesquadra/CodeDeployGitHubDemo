s:987:"<p>The Reengagement activity provides a way for you to send timely notifications to students and 3rd parties, which can include reminders to return to the course and complete activities.</p>

<p>The notification trigger is a specified period of time after a starting event, which may be enrolment in the course, completing an activity, or other course variables.
Notifications can be set to repeat for a limited run, and/or until the target activity is completed, and can have delay periods between repeats.
If the user has already completed the target activity, no email is sent.</p>

<p>You could use this plugin to:</p>

<ul><li>Selectively release timed content in a course.</li>
<li>Repeatedly remind students that an assignment is overdue.</li>
<li>Advise training managers that the course is complete.</li>
</ul><p>The Reengagement activity is very flexible, explore what you can do with it.</p>
